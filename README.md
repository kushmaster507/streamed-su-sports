# Streamed Su Sports Playlists

Streamed su is a platform that offers live sports streaming on their website. Users can stream and watch sports directly through their browser without the need for an account or subscription.

For added flexibility, this repository provides an M3U playlist featuring Streamed su's channels. With this, you can load the streams into any IPTV application that supports M3U-formatted playlists.

You can view the latest events added to the playlist [here](https://github.com/dtankdempse/streamed-su-sports/blob/main/events.txt).

## M3U-Playlist-Proxy (MPP) Required!

Due to recent updates by Streamed Su Sports, the M3U-Playlist-Proxy (MPP) is now required to stream this playlist. To get started, check out the video guide on setting up and downloading the M3U-Playlist-Proxy, available at this [GitHub link](https://github.com/dtankdempse/m3u-playlist-proxy). If you’re already using the MPP proxy, please update to the latest version by pulling the new Docker image, downloading the updated zip, or redeploying to Vercel to ensure you have the latest changes.


- **Playlist.m3u8**  
  This is a standard M3U playlist. To use it, load the Playlist URL into MPP and ensure both the `Referer` and `User-Agent` headers are correctly configured. Set the `Referer` to `https://embedme.top/` and use a compatible `User-Agent` string to enable stream access. Without these headers, streaming attempts will result in a 403 error.


  - **Playlist URL:** [https://bit.ly/su-m3u1](https://bit.ly/su-m3u1)
  - **EPG URL:** [https://bit.ly/su-epg](https://bit.ly/su-epg)
  - **Referer:** `https://embedme.top/`
  - **User-Agent:** `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:132.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/132.0`  
    (Alternatively, you may use your own User-Agent string.)

## Playlist and EPG Syncing:

The playlist and EPG data are updated every 4 hours. Since streaming data can change frequently, it’s recommended to sync the refresh of both your playlist and guide information simultaneously in your IPTV application. If you notice 'No information' being displayed in the guide, try manually refreshing the EPG within your application to ensure the most up-to-date data is loaded.

## Sports:

Basketball, Football, American Football, Hockey, Baseball, Motor Sports, Fight (UFC, Boxing), Tennis, Rugby, Golf, Billiards, AFL, Darts, Cricket, Other
